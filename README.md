[Wordle Problem](https://www.comap.org/membership/member-resources/item/predicting-wordle-results)

This project is an analysis of the Wordle results from 2022, focusing on both player performance and puzzle difficulty. The goal is to identify trends within the dataset that can help predict outcomes of future puzzles.

Previous research has shown that people have developed optimal algorithms using dynamic programming, typically solving Wordle in three to four guesses on average, with **“SALET”** recognized as a particularly strong starting word.

Building on this, our plan is to create a model that predicts the average number of guesses required to solve a puzzle based on word characteristics, while also modeling puzzle difficulty to forecast future outcomes.

By analyzing the 2022 results in this way, we aim to uncover insights into how players perform relative to puzzle challenges and provide valuable strategies for improving solving approaches.
